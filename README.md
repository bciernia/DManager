# DManager

The application allows the user to store all the items needed to run an rpg campaign in one place. Have you lost many times the file with NPCs that players are just asking for? This app is for you!

The application will allow the game master to store the currently running campaign, along with the played scenarios. In addition, the user has the ability to save all the characters that are involved in the campaign, and not just player characters. The user can add NPCs as well as monsters and animals, which can then be linked to the scenario being played, making it easy to find the statistics and descriptions needed. 
Another element is the spells, which the user can select from a prepared list that has all the spells for Dungeons and Dragons 5e, and can create his own, which he can then add to the total pool of spells. Thanks to this, we will no longer have to look through the manual or search for the right card with statistics. Also artifacts and items possessed by players, will be able to be saved in one place.
